Your winter wonderland visualization can be any kind you like, but the project must have the
following basic functionality:

• 3-dimensional objects and views (note: fixed top-down orthographic view not allowed).

• User interaction and camera-control (already graded during mid-term)

a. user should be able to move around the scene using the keyboard and/or the
mouse. At a minimum, implement moving forwards and backwards, turning left
and turning right.

• A Hierarchical animated creature relevant to the theme (already graded during midterm)

• A crowd of animated snow-people/reindeer/robins. The crowd can be implemented in
any way that you like, boids can be implemented as an Advanced Feature and having a
hierarchical character for each crowd member is also an Advanced Feature. At a
minimum, the creatures should be translating around the scene, e.g., forwards and
backwards. (15% for crowd)

• Texture-mapping your scene and creatures using an image file (e.g., jpg). (approx. 15%)

• Implementation of the Phong Illumination model. Specular highlights must be visible.
(approx. 15%)

a. Multiple light sources (at least 2, can be point, directional, or spotlight)

b. Multiple different material properties (at least 5 on 5 different objects – e.g.,
you could have several crowd characters with different material properties)
c. Normal must be transformed correctly

d. Shading must use a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
This basic functionality is worth approximately 45% of the project mark
The final 55% (approx.) will be given for advanced features, with approximately 15% per perfectlyexecuted feature – simple features will receive less, elaborate or well-designed features will receive
more. You have some scope to put effort into your favourite aspects of 3D graphics, or experiment
with new ideas.

Advanced Features can include the following, or indeed others that you think of:

• More complex boids/crowd animation

• Hierarchical creatures that move realistically in your crowd

• Advanced rendering/lighting effects

• Advanced animation

• Collision detection

• Simulated dynamics or physics of any sort

• Intelligent Characters

• Great models that you made yourself

• Height-mapped terrain

• Procedurally generated terrain or meshes

• 3D “picking” to select game objects with the mouse cursor

• More advanced texturing effects; multi-texturing, environment-mapping, bumpmapping, specular-mapping, etc.

• Partially transparent geometry using alpha-blending

• Smoke of fog

• On-screen control panels (using QT or other library)

• cube mapping for sky-boxes, environment mapping, or refraction

• ??? – your own feature ideas
